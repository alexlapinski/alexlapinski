I've started exploring Terraform and GCP.

I took a look at GCP specifically because I wanted to be able to create a simple google script that would parse incoming emails and save the images to google photos.

So, of course i went down the rabbit hole of learning terraform and GCP, because I've wanted to learn those as well.

Here's how i've setup my GCP instance based on the scripts i've run and the original tutorial I've been following.
