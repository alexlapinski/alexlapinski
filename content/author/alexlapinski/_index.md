  I am a Software Engineer and Architect. Most of my interests are around software development, service architecture and general tinkering around.

  I typically will play around with tools ranging from DevOps, Infrastructure and other hardware platforms (RapsberryPi) to novel database engines and new software architectures as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence (really just complex computer science).

  When I'm not working, I'll be found playing a plethora of strategy games, or board games with the family.
